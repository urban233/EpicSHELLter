TEA documentation
=================

TEA is a Task Event-based Async library for Python.

Think: "C# Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP) combined with the Task pattern written in Python for PyQt5 applications."

.. important::
   ðŸ“£ **As of May 2024 TEA is still in early development.** ðŸ“£

   At the time of writing, only a subset of functions are available.
   These are mainly legacy classes that can be used out-of-the-box.

   TEA is a best-effort open project library. This means that support is not
   guaranteed and how long the project will be maintained is unknown.
